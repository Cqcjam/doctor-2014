 * Java Reflection in Action is unique in presenting a clear account of all the
 * cool things you can do with reflection, and at the same time pro- viding the
 * sound conceptual basis that developers need to create advanced applications.
 * The book includes careful explanations of sometimes perplexing programming
 * techniques along with enough background to understand how to extend and vary
 * them. This book overcomes reflection’s reputation as a mysterious and
 * esoteric philo- sophical pursuit, or as a set of messy error-prone coding
 * tricks. As reflection becomes increasingly common and useful in all sorts of
 * applications, it is great to finally have a book that features disci- plined
 * yet still creative and fun software engineering practices based on
 * reflection. Even occasional users will immediately adopt the book’s patterns
 * and idioms to solve common problems. Many of the examples can be directly
 * adapted for customized solutions in diverse areas such as XML processing,
 * automated software testing, and pro- gram analysis tools. Readers will also
 * find underlying rationales for code performing introspection, proxies, class
 * loading, and so on, that are often seen but not often explained well in
 * everyday Java pro- grams. And even experts will find new ideas and
 * well-thought out advice for using some of the more subtle aspects of
 * reflection. —Prof. Doug Lea, SUNY Oswego, author of Concurrent Programming in
 * Java Java has brought reflection to the programming masses, but they're still
 * struggling with it. The Formans turn struggle into adventure as they guide
 * you through one compelling example after another, each one illustrating
 * reflection’s power while avoiding its pitfalls. —Dr. John Vlissides, IBM
 * —coauthor of Design Patterns
